hwdash-prototype
================

Prototype for getting hwinfo data into D3

This should be pretty easy to get running on Linux (and only Linux I think). You should install `hwinfo` (debian is `apt-get install hwinfo`) and Python 2.7. Other than that, no special requirements...

Just run `./main.py` and hit `localhost:8000` in a web browser.
